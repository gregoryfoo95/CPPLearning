# C++ Learning Journey for Beginner Robotics Engineer

Welcome to your personalized C++ learning program tailored for robotics! This roadmap is structured into **3 progressive phases**, each designed to build up your skills from foundational programming to robotics-oriented systems.

---

## üìÖ **Phase 1: Core Modern C++ (Weeks 1‚Äì4)**

### **Week 1 ‚Äì C++ Basics**
**Topics**: Data types, control flow, functions, references/pointers, vectors  
**Project**: `CLI Calculator`
- Input: Expression as a string (e.g. `5 * (3 + 2)`)
- Output: Result of expression
- Features:
  - Basic expression parser
  - Operator precedence
  - Error handling (e.g. divide by zero)

---

### **Week 2 ‚Äì OOP and Class Design**
**Topics**: Classes, constructors/destructors, encapsulation, inheritance  
**Project**: `Sensor Simulator`
- Implement a base class `Sensor` with method `read()`
- Inherit `TemperatureSensor`, `DistanceSensor`, `PressureSensor`
- Features:
  - Virtual methods
  - Constructor logging
  - Destructor cleanup

üö© Week 2 ‚Äì OOP & Class Design
Goal
Get comfortable defining C++ classes, constructors/destructors, encapsulation, inheritance, and virtual methods by modeling a family of ‚ÄúSensor‚Äù objects.

üõ† Tasks & Features
Define a polymorphic base class Sensor

File: include/Sensor.hpp

Members (protected/private):

std::string id;

double lastReading;

API (public):

class Sensor {
public:
  explicit Sensor(const std::string &sensorId);
  virtual ~Sensor();
  virtual double read() = 0;        // pure virtual
  std::string getId() const;
  double getLastReading() const;
protected:
  void setLastReading(double v);
};
Concepts: constructors & destructors, access specifiers, virtual methods, =0 abstract base class, encapsulation via protected setter.

Implement concrete sensor subclasses

Files:

src/TemperatureSensor.cpp & .hpp

src/DistanceSensor.cpp & .hpp

src/PressureSensor.cpp & .hpp

Behavior:

Each overrides double read() to simulate a value (e.g., random in a range).

Calls setLastReading(...) internally.

Concepts: inheritance, override keyword, std::mt19937 or std::random_device, including <random>.

Test your classes with a simple driver

File: src/test_sensors.cpp

In main():

Instantiate one of each sensor:


std::unique_ptr<Sensor> t = std::make_unique<TemperatureSensor>("T1");
std::unique_ptr<Sensor> d = std::make_unique<DistanceSensor>("D1");
Call read() three times on each, printing getId() and getLastReading().

Concepts: smart pointers, dynamic polymorphism, loops.

Ensure clean memory management

Confirm destructors are virtual.

Use std::unique_ptr<Sensor> to hold polymorphic objects.

Encapsulation & const-correctness

Mark getters const.

Keep lastReading and id private or protected.

Avoid exposing internal state via non-const methods.

üß† Concepts You‚Äôll Master

Concept	Details
Constructors/Destructors	explicit single-arg, default dtor, virtual dtor
Inheritance	class Derived : public Sensor
Polymorphism	virtual double read() override
Encapsulation	private vs protected vs public
Smart Pointers	std::unique_ptr<Sensor> for ownership
Const-Correctness	getId() const, getLastReading() const
Random Number Generation	<random> engines and distributions
‚úÖ Deliverable
By the end of Week 2 you should have:

Header files (include/Sensor.hpp, include/TemperatureSensor.hpp, etc.) with well-documented class definitions.

Source files implementing each class.

A test driver (test_sensors.cpp) that instantiates each sensor, calls read(), and prints results.

A CMakeLists.txt entry to build a sensor_test executable alongside your calculator.

### **Week 3 ‚Äì STL, Smart Pointers, RAII**
**Topics**: `std::vector`, `std::map`, `unique_ptr`, RAII, `optional`  
**Project**: `Sensor Manager`
- Class `SensorManager` manages list of sensors
- Add/remove/list sensors
- Features:
  - Use `unique_ptr<Sensor>`
  - Access by ID (via map)
  - Optional return on missing sensor

Choosing between std::map (a balanced tree) and std::unordered_map (a hash table) comes down to your performance needs and how you intend to use the container. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key differences and when you might prefer one over the other:

1. Iteration Order
std::map

Ordered by key.

When you call listSensorIds(), you get IDs in sorted order.

Useful if consistent, reproducible output order matters (e.g., logging, UIs).

std::unordered_map

Unordered iteration.

Keys appear in an implementation-defined order that can change as the map resizes.

Slightly faster to insert/erase but unpredictable order.

2. Time Complexity Guarantees

Operation	std::map	std::unordered_map
Lookup	O(log n)	O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case
Insert/Erase	O(log n)	O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case
Iteration	In-order	Unordered
std::map provides strict O(log n) for all operations‚Äîno pathological cases.

std::unordered_map offers average O(1) but in the worst case (many hash collisions) can degrade to O(n).

3. Memory & Overhead
std::map

Each node stores two pointers (left/right), one parent pointer, plus key+value.

Lower average memory per element compared to a hash table‚Äôs buckets + potential slack.

std::unordered_map

Allocates buckets (arrays) and elements; may have extra unused slots to maintain load factor.

More memory overhead, especially if you reserve large capacity.

4. Determinism & Real-Time Constraints
std::map‚Äôs O(log n) bound is deterministic, making it attractive for systems where worst-case behavior matters (e.g., real-time robotics loops).

std::unordered_map‚Äôs average case is fast, but the worst-case hash collision scenario might be unacceptable in latency-sensitive code.

5. When to Use Which

Use Case	Recommendation
You need sorted iteration (e.g., menus, logs)	std::map
Your listSensorIds() must always be sorted	std::map
You have millions of sensors and care about raw lookup speed (average case)	std::unordered_map
You‚Äôre in a real-time or safety-critical loop and need bounded latency	std::map
You don‚Äôt care about order and want simpler code	std::unordered_map
TL;DR
std::map = ordered keys, guaranteed O(log n), predictable iteration, lower memory overhead.

std::unordered_map = average O(1) lookup, unpredictable iteration order, higher memory overhead, potential worst-case slowdown.

For your SensorManager, if you want to list IDs in sorted order or need deterministic performance, std::map is a solid default. If you later find that iteration order and worst-case latency aren‚Äôt concerns, you can always switch to std::unordered_map for slightly faster average lookups.
